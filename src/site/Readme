JCS - JUL Comment System

 = About =

JCS - JUL Comment System is a way of documenting your JavaScript source code 
while keeping the comments in a separate file. 
It allows you to associate the comments to any version of the source code 
and to get the updated commented code. 
Also, JCS is able to generate and to document the code 
for an entire JavaScript namespace or DOM tree loaded by a web page.

 * saves the comments as a separate project for reuse and management of documenting different versions of the code

 * downloading the collection of generated source files as a zip package
