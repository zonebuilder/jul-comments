        <h2>About JCS</h2>
        <p>JCS - <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jul-javascript/">JUL</a> Comment System 
		is a way of documenting your JavaScript source code while keeping the comments in a separate file. It allows 
		you to associate the comments to any version of the source code and to get the updated commented code. 
		 Also, JCS is able to generate and to document the code for an entire JavaScript namespace or 
		 DOM tree loaded by a web page.
        </p>
        <div id="features" class="section-2">
          <h3>Features</h3>
          <ul>
			<li>generates documented code from JavaScript source code or from runtime code</li>
			<li>saves the comments as a separate project for reuse and management of documenting different versions of the code</li>
			<li>recognizes types of data and generates comments blocks accordingly</li>
			<li>splits a JavaScript namespace into  a custom number of child namespaces as documented source files with their corresponding code</li>
			<li>downloading the collection of generated source files as a zip package</li>

        <h2>Using JCS</h2>
        <p>In order to generate the code, you must supply a web page which creates some JavaScript objects. 
		The typical procedure is to include the scripts that generate the configuration objects in a page 
		from your site and navigate to that page using JCS. The loaded page or site and the JCS application 
		should adhere to Same Domain Policy (SDP). A practical case is installing JCS in a location 
		on your web server and to document with it a site from the same server. As we will see later, 
		it is not mandatory to create special pages for documenting your sites.
        </p>
      <div id="what-code" class="section-2">
        <h3>What kind of code is generated?</h3>
        <p>JCS uses JUL to generate JavaScript code, so you should generally document configuration objects 
		and namespaces. But JCS can generate code for any DOM tree loaded in the page, while only the formatting 
		being specifying to JUL tool. Each generated file has a simple templating system that allows you 
		to wrap the JUL code with custom JavaScript code. With these two features, a large variety of 
		JavaScript code can be documented in JCS. It is worth mentioning that, in a way, any program 
		can be regarded and rewritten as an initial configuration tree.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="creating-project" class="section-2">
        <h3>Creating a project</h3>
        <p>A project holds the comments for an entire JavaScript namespace or a configuration tree. 
		You can create a project from the ‘NP’ button on the top toolbar or by entering a site and finding 
		an object directly in the main screen. The configurable members defining a project are:
        </p>
        <ul>
				<li>project namespace - uniquely identifies the project, not necessary the same as the default object path</li>
				<li>project title - user friendly title of the project</li>
				<li>preferred site - the initial page where is searched the object or the namespace to work with</li>
				<li>default object/namespace path - the initial object or namespace to generate the code for</li>
				<li>maximum DOM levels to display - the depth of the namespace descendants to show. 
				The generated code will not be affected by this setting.</li>
				<li>list of paths to fully show – these paths will not be affected by the maximum 
				number of levels to show</li>
				<li>copyright header - copyright comment to display first in each generated file</li>
				<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jslint.com/" >JSLint</a>/<a target="_blank" href="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> 
				directives - linting comments for one of the popular JavaScript tools. They are copied and may be edited for each generated file.</li>
				<li>comma separated paths to exclude - the objects inside these paths will not generate output code and 
				won’t show up in the interface. Used to avoid parsing of certain unnecessary runtime objects.</li>
				<li>use JUL to wrap around objects – the top objects/namespaces (of class Object) in each 
				generated file will be wrapped by a JUL.ns + JUL.apply construct</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="adding-comments" class="section-2">
        <h3>Adding comments</h3>
        <p>You can add comment blocks by selecting any object shown in the DOM tree in the bottom left of the main screen. 
		Each JavaDoc comment tag is considered as being a field either single line or multiline that can appear 
		in the comment block at the specified position. JCS offers field templates for the most used JavaDoc, 
		but you can also enter a custom field with custom multiline content.<br />
		There is a special Meta field ‘&lt;replace&gt;’ that applies the replace method 
		over the code fragment in the preview pane and that doesn’t generate comment content. 
		This field may be repeated to get a fully customized code fragment for the current object.
		<br />The comment pane in the top center offers a comment block generator that hints 
		the current object data type and generates a default comment block for it.
		<br />Changes made in the comment pane are immediately reflected in the preview pane at top right. 
		That displays the generated code fragment together with its comment block if available. If the comment isn’t saved, 
		the caption of the preview pane ends with an asterisk.
		<br />To save a comment, press ‘Apply’ button. The code pane that contains the content of the generated files 
		will reflect the change.
        </p>
      	<div><a class="to-top" href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
      </div>
      <div id="generated-files" class="section-2">
        <h3>Generated files</h3>
        <p>For each object in the DOM tree pane, there are custom actions available as checkboxes in the toolbar 
		at the bottom of the pane. The first check ‘separate file, put outside’ allows you 
		to generate a separate file holding the code for that node and its descendents. 
		The code in that file will not appear in the other files. The ‘put outside’ textbox may contain 
		member names of the current object that will appear outside the main code at the end of the file. 
		This allows splitting large trees of code in several sub-trees put one offer the other.
		</p>
      </div>
      <div id="other-custom" class="section-2">
        <h3>Other custom operations</h3>
        <p>If an object is a function, JCS can generate its prototype code by checking the ‘show prototype’ checkbox 
		in the bottom toolbar of the DOM tree pane.<br />
		For each node in DOM tree pane has an object data type, JCS can sort its members, putting the private ones 
		(those who start with an underscore) last, by checking the ‘sort members’ checkbox in the same toolbar.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="file-config" class="section-2">
        <h3>File configuration</h3>
        <p>At the bottom of the main screen, there is the code pane that shows the generated comments files.<br />
		Each file has several properties that can be accessed with the ‘Properties’ button at the top right in the code pane, 
		These properties are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jslint.com/" >JSLint</a>/<a target="_blank" href="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> 
			directives - initially inherited form the project ones, you can modify them here for the current file</li>
			<li>file template - simple template system to generate and customize file code. 
			Available template variables are: ‘{copyright}’ the project copyright header, ‘{fileOverview}’ the file overview comment block, 
			‘{jslint}’ the limiting directives, and ‘{code}’ the generated JavaScript commented code.</li>
			<li>use JUL to wrap around objects – JUL object wrapping configurable at file level</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Besides using the ‘separate file’ checkbox, a file can be removed using the ‘Remove’ button 
		in the top right corner of the code pane. Removing a file puts its content into the parent file
		 i.e. the file with the namespace immediately above the removed file. The root file corresponding to the root 
		 of the displayed DOM tree cannot be removed (you can change the root path though, making this file an inner one).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="saving" class="section-2">
        <h3>Saving the project & downloading the code</h3>
        <p>While the project is being modified, the ‘Save project’ button is enabled, allowing saving 
		the current contents of the project. After successfully saving the project, the ‘Download code’ button becomes enabled 
		and you can download the collection of the generated file as a zip package.
		<br />Saving a project does filter the memorized comments and its file structure upon the default object/namespace path 
		that is used to generate its contents. This avoids bloating a project with unnecessary content as is being updated 
		by the ‘save’ operations.

        <h3>The edit dialog box</h3>
        <p>Comment fields that are multiline have a ‘Edit’ button at their right side. This launches the edit dialog 
		which allows entering multiline content in that field. If the field has multiple lines, 
		its textbox is read-only, the edit button being the only means to change the content.
